coffeescript-dotnet
===================

coffeescript-dotnet provides means to compiles coffeescript on a Windows platform, using a pure .NET implementation (apart from the coffeescript compiler itself, written in Javascript).

It relies on [Jurassic](http://jurassic.codeplex.net/) for compiling javascript, and of course [coffeescript] (http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) for compiling coffeescript to js.

ncoffee is a command-line compiler akin to coffee (with some options stripped). It does not rely on node to work.
